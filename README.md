# SDEV140-Hello-World
class project
# this file was created for a class project in SDEV140 Computer languages. I have no experence with computer languages so it is an uphill battle and when I say battle I mean crawling up hill in the dark on broken glass with a beast on my back forcing me to achive the goal with out enough time to unerstand how to get there, but other than that I am having a great time with people I really like to be around.  It seems that the pressure takes all the fun out of programing development. I can hardly wait for a job in the real world.
